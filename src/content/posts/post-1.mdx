Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.
   A note<SideNote>This is the content of the first side note.</SideNote>. Here's another one<SideNote>This is the content of the second side note. It's very long and will wrap to the next line. I'm sure of it. Don't ever doubt me.</SideNote>

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.
   A second note<SideNote>This is the content of the second side note. It's very long and will wrap to the next line. I'm sure of it. Don't ever doubt me.</SideNote>

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

[^1]: Making pages is a bit more involved than I thought it would be. I'm still working on it. I'll update this post when I have it done.
