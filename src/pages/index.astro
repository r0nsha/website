        I'm a coder that loves coding in an editor that's purposely build for coding.
        <br />
        For some mysterious reason, I also use it for everything else <i>(Yes, it's Neovim)</i>.

        This is a place where I post up various half-baked ideas and opinions about programming, and
        maybe some other topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also co-host an <a href="https://www.ptsg.dev" target="_blank">awesome podcast</a>, where
        I blabber about my unsolicited opinions in Hebrew.

        The JavaScript event loop coordinates the <code>call stack</code>, the <code
            >callback queue</code
        >, and the <code>microtask queue</code> so that synchronous code runs first, then microtasks
        (like Promise callbacks) execute, and finally queued callbacks (e.g. <code>setTimeout</code
        >) are processedâ€”allowing non-blocking I/O while keeping a single threaded runtime
        predictable.
