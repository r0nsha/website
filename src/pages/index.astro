<Base>
    <p>
        I'm a coder that loves coding in an editor that's purposely build for coding.
        <br />
        For some mysterious reason, I also use it for everything else <i>(Yes, it's Neovim)</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a place where I post up various half-baked ideas and opinions about programming, and
        maybe some other topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also co-host an <a href="https://www.ptsg.dev" target="_blank">awesome podcast</a>, where
        I blabber about my unsolicited opinions in Hebrew.
